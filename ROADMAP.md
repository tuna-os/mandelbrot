# Mandelbrot Roadmap

**Last updated**: 2026-08-24 | **Maintainer**: tuna-os (hanthor)

## Mission

Give the TunaOS ecosystem a first-class Matrix messaging app for GNOME:
secure, modern, and optimized for collaboration in large groups. Mandelbrot
forks [Fractal](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/) and pushes further
into the modern Matrix feature set — native MatrixRTC voice/video calling,
simplified sliding sync, QR login, threads, polls — so users who live in
Matrix get a native desktop experience instead of a web app.

## Current Status

- **Published**: flatpak `org.tunaos.mandelbrot` on the tuna-os remote
  (install verified end-to-end, 2026-07-23); landing page at
  tunaos.org/mandelbrot; docs at tunaos.org/docs/mandelbrot.
- **Distribution**: OCI flatpak published to GHCR via `publish-flatpak.yml`
  on `v*` tag push. **No GitHub Releases page** — no binaries, no checksums,
  no changelog on the Releases surface (see #73).
- **Latest tag**: v14.1.1 (2026-07-24, OCI publish ran). No tag since,
  despite active development (commits through 08-14+).
- **Differentiators**: native MatrixRTC calls (Element Call v0.22.0 interop
  verified — see tests/e2e/CONFORMANCE.md), sliding sync (MSC4186) with
  classic fallback, QR login (MSC4108), threads, polls, spaces hierarchy.
- **CI health**: MatrixRTC e2e failing every nightly for 10 consecutive days
  (#66); h2 RUSTSEC-2026 pending (#69/#70).
