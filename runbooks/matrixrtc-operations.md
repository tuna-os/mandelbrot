## 1. Architecture Overview

Mandelbrot implements native MatrixRTC real-time group communications
support (`matrixrtc/`), which interoperates with the Matrix ecosystem
(MSC3401, MSC4143, MSC4140, MSC4195, and LiveKit SFU).

### Core Stack Components

* **Homeserver (Synapse)**: Provides Matrix Client-Server and Federation
  APIs, delayed leave tracking (MSC4140), and user authentication.
* **LiveKit SFU**: Selective Forwarding Unit providing WebRTC media routing
  and E2EE frame distribution.
* **LiveKit JWT Service (`lk-jwt-service`)**: Validates Matrix OpenID tokens
  via federation endpoints to issue SFU join tokens.
* **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Terminate internal TLS for federation validation
  while routing plain HTTP client access on host port 8008.

## 2. Operational Readiness

Before running test harnesses or deploying client updates, verify that each
service in the compose stack responds to health and readiness checks.

The harness does not hard-code a compose provider. `stack_up` in
`tests/e2e/harness-lib.sh` picks `podman compose` or `docker compose`,
whichever is installed, and honours `COMPOSE` when it is set. The commands
below use `$COMPOSE` so they match whatever the harness itself selected:

```sh
export COMPOSE="podman compose"   # or: docker compose
```

### Port Allocation and Health Endpoints

| Service | Port | Endpoint / Health Check | Expected Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Synapse HTTP | `8008` | `GET http://127.0.0.1:8008/_matrix/client/versions` | HTTP 200 OK |
| LiveKit SFU | `7880` | `GET http://127.0.0.1:7880/` | HTTP 200 (LiveKit response) |
| LiveKit JWT | `6080` | `GET http://127.0.0.1:6080/healthz` | HTTP 200 OK |
| Synapse Federation | `8448` | `GET https://127.0.0.1:8448/_matrix/federation/v1/version` | HTTP 200 OK |

### Manual Health Verification Procedure

1. Verify Synapse Client-Server readiness. This is the URL `wait_for`
   polls, with the same 180-second budget the harness allows it:

   ```sh
   curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8008/_matrix/client/versions >/dev/null \
     && echo "Synapse HTTP: OK" || echo "Synapse HTTP: FAIL"
   ```

2. Verify LiveKit SFU readiness (60-second budget in the harness):

   ```sh
   curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:7880/ \
     && echo "LiveKit SFU: OK" || echo "LiveKit SFU: FAIL"
   ```

3. Verify LiveKit JWT auth handler readiness (60-second budget). The
   compose service is named `auth-service`; `lk-jwt-service` is the image:

   ```sh
   curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:6080/healthz \
     && echo "LiveKit JWT: OK" || echo "LiveKit JWT: FAIL"
   ```

## 3. Troubleshooting MatrixRTC E2E Failures

The MatrixRTC conformance test suite (`tests/e2e/`) validates wire
conformance across multiple scenarios.

### Common Failure Modes and Mitigations

#### Failure Mode A: Synapse Container Fails to Start or Times Out

* **Symptom**: `wait_for` in `tests/e2e/harness-lib.sh` gives up and calls
  `die`, so the run ends with
  `synapse did not come up at http://127.0.0.1:8008/_matrix/client/versions`.
  The same message appears with `livekit` or `lk-jwt-service` in place of
  `synapse` when one of those is the service that never answered.
* **Root Causes**:
  * Port conflict on host port `8008` or `8448`.
  * Database lock or uncleaned state in temporary directory.
* **Mitigation Steps**:
  1. Inspect container logs:

     ```sh
     $COMPOSE -f tests/e2e/compose.yml logs synapse
     ```

  2. Identify and clear conflicting host processes:

     ```sh
     ss -tulpn | grep -E '8008|8448|7880|6080'
     ```

  3. Tear down orphaned containers and volumes:

     ```sh
     $COMPOSE -f tests/e2e/compose.yml down -v
     ```

#### Failure Mode B: Media Frame Decryption or Key Exchange Failure

* **Symptom**: A scenario reaches the call but no client reports a
  received key, so `run-huddle.sh` and `run-interop.sh` fail their
  `io.element.call.encryption_keys` assertions.
* **Root Causes**:
  * LiveKit frame cryptor did not receive matching encryption keys.
  * UDP media port range blocked by the host firewall. LiveKit is
    configured for `50100-50200` in `tests/e2e/livekit/livekit.yaml`
    (`rtc.port_range_start` / `rtc.port_range_end`).
* **Mitigation Steps**:
  1. Inspect UDP port accessibility on the test host:

     ```sh
     nc -z -v -u 127.0.0.1 50100
     ```

  2. Verify that host networking is enabled for the LiveKit container in
     `tests/e2e/compose.yml`.
  3. Review the evidence bundle for to-device key transport events
     (`io.element.call.encryption_keys`). Each runner writes its own
     directory under `tests/e2e/logs/`, named for the scenario and the
     start time — `huddle-<timestamp>/`, `interop-<timestamp>/`,
     `resilience-<timestamp>/`, `federation-<order>-<timestamp>/`. The
     path is printed at the end of the run as `evidence bundle: ...`.

## 4. Service Diagnostics

When investigating federation or token issuance failures:

### Inspecting LiveKit JWT Service Federation Handshake

1. Verify Nginx certificate and SNI routing for `synapse.m.localhost`:

   ```sh
   curl -kv --resolve synapse.m.localhost:8448:127.0.0.1 \
     https://synapse.m.localhost:8448/_matrix/federation/v1/version
   ```

2. Check OpenID token resolution logs in the JWT service. The compose
   service is `auth-service`, not `lk-jwt`:

   ```sh
   $COMPOSE -f tests/e2e/compose.yml logs auth-service
   ```

### Recovering from Orphaned Test Environments

To reset the test environment completely:

```sh
# Stop containers and remove volumes
$COMPOSE -f tests/e2e/compose.yml down -v --remove-orphans

# The federated topology is a separate stack, not an overlay on the first
$COMPOSE -f tests/e2e/compose-federated.yml down -v --remove-orphans

# Clean transient test logs older than 7 days
find tests/e2e/logs/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} +
```

## 5. Flatpak Release and CI Pipeline Operations

### Flatpak Build Verification

Mandelbrot is packaged as Flatpak application `org.tunaos.mandelbrot`.

* **Local Verification via Flatpak-Builder**:

  ```sh
  flatpak-builder --user --force-clean --install-deps-from=flathub \
    --repo=_repo build-dir org.tunaos.mandelbrot.json
  ```

* **Publish Trigger Policy**:
  * Releases are triggered by pushing a version tag (e.g. `v0.1.0`) or via
    workflow dispatch (`.github/workflows/publish-flatpak.yml`).
  * Workflow utilizes `tuna-os/.github/.github/workflows/publish-flatpak.yml@main`.

### Release Rollback Procedure

If a release tag fails post-publish validation or triggers critical regressions:

1. Flag the release as prerelease or revoked in GitHub Releases.
2. In the Flathub repository, revert the manifest commit to the previous
   known good tag.
3. Notify the release team on Matrix/Discord coordination channels.
