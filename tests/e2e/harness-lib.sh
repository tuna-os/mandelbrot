# --- compose ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Set COMPOSE in the environment to force a provider (e.g. COMPOSE="docker
# compose" on a runner that has podman installed but no podman backend).
#
# Auto-detection asks each candidate to talk to its backend rather than just
# checking that the binary is on PATH: `<provider> version` answers happily
# with nothing running behind it, which is how a runner that ships a podman
# binary but never starts the podman socket selects `podman compose` and then
# dies on `up -d`. `ps` has to reach the engine to answer, so it separates
# "installed" from "usable". Nothing here can tell which engine already holds
# the images, so CI still pins COMPOSE explicitly; this only keeps an
# unpinned host from picking a provider that cannot work.
