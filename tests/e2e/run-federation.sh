# MatrixRTC e2e TEST 6: federated call across two homeservers.
#
# Equivalent of Element Call's
#   playwright/widget/federation-oldest-membership-bug.spec.ts
#   playwright/widget/federated-call.test.ts
#
# Topology (compose.yml + compose-federated.yml):
#   site 1  synapse.m.localhost            SFU :7880   JWT :6080
#   site 2  synapse.othersite.m.localhost  SFU :17880  JWT :16080
#
# The property under test is the one EC's bug report is about: the client
# that joins second must publish on the SFU of the OLDEST membership — which
# lives on the *other* homeserver — and not on its own preferred SFU. If it
# gets that wrong, both sides connect to different SFUs and nobody sees
# anybody ("Waiting for media…" in EC's UI; no subscribed tracks here).
#
# The engine-level version of the same assertion runs on every PR as
# `federation_oldest_membership_*` in matrixrtc/tests/element_call_scenarios.rs.
# This script proves it over the wire, including the part the unit tests
# cannot cover: that site 2's client can actually obtain an MSC4195 token
# from site 1's auth service using an OpenID token issued by site 2, which
# lk-jwt-service validates over federation.
#
# Usage: JOIN_CALL_BIN=... ./run-federation.sh [order]
#   order: remote-first (default) — site 2 creates the call, site 1 joins
#          local-first             — site 1 creates the call, site 2 joins
# Env:   KEEP_STACK=1  keep the containers afterwards.
