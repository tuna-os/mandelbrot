# MatrixRTC e2e TEST 5: group call ("huddle").
#
# Equivalent of Element Call's playwright/widget/huddle-call.test.ts, which
# puts five participants in one room call and asserts that every client sees
# five tiles, nobody is stuck on "Waiting for media…", and a mute on one
# participant is reflected everywhere.
#
# We have no tiles, so the equivalents are:
#   - five well-formed `m.call.member` state events,
#   - every client's membership list contains all five,
#   - every client received an `io.element.call.encryption_keys` key from
#     each of the other four (this is the key-distribution fan-out that
#     actually breaks in large calls),
#   - every client subscribed to at least four remote tracks,
#   - one participant leaving is noticed by all the others,
#   - one participant being killed is cleaned up by the MSC4140 delayed leave
#     and noticed by all the others.
#
# Usage: JOIN_CALL_BIN=... ./run-huddle.sh [participants]
# Env:   KEEP_STACK=1   keep the containers afterwards
#        SETTLE_S       seconds to let the call stabilise (default 45)
