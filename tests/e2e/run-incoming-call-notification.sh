# Reproduces the "no incoming-call GUI in Mandelbrot" report as an automated
# test, and pinpoints WHERE the ring is lost.
#
# Mandelbrot rings when the SDK's notification handler fires, and that only
# happens if the homeserver decides an m.rtc.notification (MSC4075) event
# should notify the callee — i.e. a push rule matches with a `notify` action.
# This test sends a real m.rtc.notification and asks the server, via the
# client API, whether it flagged it for the callee. No GUI, no desktop
# notification daemon — those are downstream of the question this answers.
#
# RESULT lines: PASS / FAIL. Exit 1 if any RESULT is FAIL.
#
# Usage: ./run-incoming-call-notification.sh
