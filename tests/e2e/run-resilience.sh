# MatrixRTC e2e TEST 3: reconnect / resilience.
#
# Equivalents of the two Element Call specs that gate connection resilience:
#
#   playwright/sfu-reconnect-bug.spec.ts
#     "When creator left, avoid reconnect to the same SFU" (EC issue #3344).
#     EC counts LiveKit websocket connections on a third guest and asserts
#     the count does not grow when the call creator leaves. Here we count the
#     MSC4195 `/sfu/get` requests reaching lk-jwt-service, plus LiveKit
#     websocket upgrades reaching the SFU, attributable to the surviving
#     client after the creator leaves.
#
#   playwright/reconnect.spec.ts
#     "can only interact with header and footer while reconnecting". The UI
#     half is not applicable; the engine half is: stall the homeserver past
#     the MSC4140 delayed-leave delay, and the client must enter the
#     probably-left ("Reconnecting…") state and then recover its membership
#     once the homeserver answers again.
#
# Plus one scenario EC has no e2e for but that our stack can express: an SFU
# restart under a live call.
#
# Usage: JOIN_CALL_BIN=... ./run-resilience.sh
# Env:   KEEP_STACK=1  keep the containers afterwards.
