# MatrixRTC e2e TEST 4: restricted SFU / JWT behaviour.
#
# Equivalent of Element Call's playwright/restricted-sfu.spec.ts and the JWT
# half of playwright/errors.spec.ts.
#
# EC gates two properties:
#
#   1. "Should request JWT token before starting the call" — the MSC4195
#      `/sfu/get` request must complete BEFORE the `m.call.member` state
#      event is sent. The point is that on a deployment where call creation
#      is restricted to authorised users, an unauthorised client must never
#      advertise a membership it cannot back with media.
#
#   2. "Error when pre-warming the focus are caught by the ErrorBoundary" /
#      "Should show error screen if fails to get JWT token" — a non-retryable
#      JWT failure must surface as an error instead of a half-joined call,
#      and a retryable one (429) must be retried.
#
# Property 1 is the interesting one for Mandelbrot, because our join path is
# ordered the other way round (see the report in CONFORMANCE.md): the
# membership manager publishes the state event, and only then does the media
# task resolve the focus and fetch the JWT. This script measures it rather
# than asserting a behaviour we do not have, so the recorded RESULT lines are
# the evidence.
#
# Usage: JOIN_CALL_BIN=... ./run-restricted-sfu.sh
# Env:   KEEP_STACK=1  keep the containers afterwards.

# SCENARIO 1 — ordering: JWT fetch vs. membership state event
# ===========================================================================
# We cannot instrument the client's internals from here, so we time both
# observable events:
#   - the SFU token arriving, which the client logs as "got SFU config"
#     immediately after the MSC4195 `/sfu/get` response,
#   - the `m.call.member` state event appearing in room state.
# Both are polled at 500 ms, which is far finer than the seconds-scale gap
# the ordering question is about. The polling must stay cheap: a
# `docker logs`/`podman logs` call per iteration reads the whole container
# log and will melt the host, so the client's own log file is used instead.
